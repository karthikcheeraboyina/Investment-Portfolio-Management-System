<h1>Investment Portfolio Management System</h1>
The Investment Portfolio Management System is a web-based application that enables financial 
institutions and individual investors to manage and monitor their investment portfolios. It provides 
functionality for portfolio creation, asset allocation, risk assessment, performance tracking, and 
reporting. This system is designed using the Sprig MVC architecture.

The system is divided into five primary modules, each addressing a critical aspect of investment portfolio 
management.  
**User Management**  
This module handles user account creation, role assignment (Investor, Admin), and profile 
management.  
**Portfolio Management**  
This module allows users to create and manage investment portfolios, including adding and 
modifying assets like stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.  
**Risk Assessment**  
This module calculates the risk level of portfolios based on asset allocation, market trends, and 
user-defined parameters.  
**Performance Tracking**  
This module monitors the performance of assets and portfolios, providing historical and real time data.  
**Reporting and Analytics**  
This module generates reports and analytics for users and administrators to make informed 
decisions.
